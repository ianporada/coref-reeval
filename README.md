# A Controlled Reevaluation of Coreference Resolution Models

## Details

All models are implemented in PyTorch, referencing the original implementations as described in the paper. Encoder-based models are trained using PyTorch Lightning,  and the decoder-based LinkAppend model is trained using HuggingFace's Trainer.

This repo includes the raw model code. Models implemented by @XiyuanZou and @ianporada.
